ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Lucas.

I have a degree in Database Technology and I am currently honing my skills at TripleTen, where I am in the second module of Data Analysis. Throughout my learning journey, I have developed several projects that reflect my passion and dedication to data analysis.

In this space, I will be pleased to share these projects with you, offering a view of my progress and the skills I have acquired. Each project is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and my pursuit of excellence.

I am looking forward to embarking on this journey of continuous learning with all of you. Let's explore the fascinating world of data analysis together, learn from each other, and grow as a community. I thank all of you for being part of this exciting adventure!
